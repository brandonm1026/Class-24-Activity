## How it works
Takes in three inputs and outputs 2. It's a one bit full adder. 

Explain how your project works
It adds binary inputs. It takes three inputs and outputs two. A Sum and a Carry. 
## How to test
You can connect Two LEDs to Output 1 and Output 2 and see if it matches the Truth table. 
Explain how to use your project
ALUs and CPUs use One bit full adders to do math in binary. 

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
